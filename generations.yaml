    description: "The Kia EV9 is the brand's flagship electric SUV and the second model built on the dedicated Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP). Featuring bold, futuristic styling inspired by Kia's 'Opposites United' design philosophy, it combines the boxy proportions of a traditional three-row SUV with distinctive futuristic elements including the 'Digital Tiger Face' front end with vertical headlights, a flat aerodynamic roofline, and distinctive 'Star Map' LED daytime running lights. With a length of approximately 5 meters, it's similar in size to the Telluride but with a significantly longer wheelbase thanks to the dedicated EV platform, maximizing interior space. Powered by a 99.8 kWh battery pack, it's available in single-motor rear-wheel drive (201 HP) or dual-motor all-wheel drive configurations (379 HP in standard dual-motor, 516 HP in GT-Line), offering up to 304 miles of range in the most efficient variant. Like the EV6, it utilizes an 800V electrical architecture enabling ultra-fast DC charging, allowing a 10-80% charge in approximately 24 minutes at compatible charging stations. The interior features a spacious three-row layout with six or seven-seat configurations, including second-row captain's chairs that can swivel to face the third row in some variants. Technology highlights include a panoramic curved display combining a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen, and 5.3-inch climate control touchscreen under a single piece of glass, a head-up display with augmented reality navigation, and comprehensive driver assistance systems including Highway Driving Pilot with conditional hands-free capability in some markets. Additional innovations include Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) functionality allowing the car to power external devices, over-the-air updates, and a comprehensive suite of connected car services. As Kia's largest and most premium electric vehicle, the EV9 challenges established luxury SUVs while pioneering the nascent three-row electric SUV segment, establishing Kia as a technology and design leader in the rapidly evolving electric vehicle market."
